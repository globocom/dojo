## Desafio: [Operator number system](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/4bwibm/20160325_challenge_259_hard_operator_number_system/)

In most cases, humans use a decimal system. Scientists have suggested that this way to count things has been defined by our hands with 5 fingers each (total of 10 fingers). When the computer was developed, the binary system was implemented because of the two options that electricity allows (current or no current). Today, weâ€™ll throw practical sensibilities in the garbage and define a system to write all the integers that is based on operators and the static natural number sequence (integers 0 or higher). Call it NOS (Natural Operator Sequence) base.
Rules

    Each digit in a number represents one of 3 operators: - 0: + 1: - 2: *
    The length of the number (count of digits) limits the natural number sequence used. A 4 digit number means the operators are inserted into the sequence 0 _ 1 _ 2 _ 3 _ 4
    Operators are inserted left to right, and there are no special precedence rules for * multiplication.
    The encoding used should use the fewest number of digits/operators possible:

Possible encodings of the number 10 are:

0000 = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4
0220 = 0 + 1 * 2 * 3 + 4
02212 = 0 + 1 * 2 * 3 - 4 * 5

Only the first 2 representations satisfy the 4th rule of being the shortest possible:

optional 5th rule: As a tie break for "correct representation" use the representation with the most 0s (representing +), and optionally if still tied, use the representation that would sort first. ex: first above 0000 representation of 10 has the most 0's. These tie breakers are arbitrary, and you may use any tie breaking scheme you want.

The number 2 can be represented as either 02 or 20. By optional last rule, 02 is the "correct" representation.

1 easy: read NOS base numbers (optional)

input:
10020

output:
21
2 hard: Find the shortest NOS representation of a decimal number

input:
21

output:
10020

Find the shortest NOS representations for numbers up to say 50.

### Philosophy bonus:

Speculate optimistically regarding interesting or practical features of using operators and a known sequence as a base system, or... merciless denigrate the optimistic fools that may dare propose thoughts.
